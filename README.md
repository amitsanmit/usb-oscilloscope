## Project Overview

The USB Oscilloscope project leverages the power of the STM32 microcontroller to create a high-performance oscilloscope. It features an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that allows for accurate signal measurement. This oscilloscope can be used in various applications, including educational purposes, circuit debugging, and waveform analysis.

## Features

- **High Sampling Rate**: Capture signals at high speeds.
- **USB Interface**: Easy connection to computers for data visualization.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Analyze signals in real time.
- **User-Friendly Software**: Intuitive interface for easy operation.
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Measure multiple signals simultaneously.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and modify the code as needed.

## Hardware Components

### Microcontroller

The heart of the oscilloscope is the STM32 microcontroller. It provides the processing power needed for signal acquisition and processing.

### Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

The ADC is crucial for converting analog signals into digital data. The selected ADC ensures high accuracy and fast conversion rates.

### Power Supply

A stable power supply is essential for the operation of the oscilloscope. The design supports various power sources, including USB power.

### Display

A display unit can be connected to visualize the waveforms. You can use an LCD or connect to a computer for graphical representation.

### Enclosure

The hardware components can be housed in a protective enclosure. This not only protects the components but also provides a professional look.

## Software Components

### Firmware

The firmware runs on the STM32 microcontroller and manages the ADC, USB communication, and data processing.

### PC Software

The PC software allows users to visualize the captured waveforms. It is built using Python and offers a simple interface for interaction.

### Libraries

The project uses several libraries to facilitate communication and data processing. Key libraries include:

- STM32 HAL Library for hardware abstraction.
- USB CDC for USB communication.
- Matplotlib for data visualization in Python.
